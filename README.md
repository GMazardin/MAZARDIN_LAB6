# MAZARDIN Grégoire LAB 6 of C# course
Lab 6 of C# by Grégoire MAZARDIN around Code Design Patterns

Main code is to be executed in the "Program.cs" file

Answers to questions can be found in the files "Exercise1.txt" and "Exercise2.txt"

For the question 2.4, I choose the Factory Method Design pattern.

Code for the question 2.2 will be found in the "PizzaBuilder.cs" and "Builder.cs" files, and code for question 2.4 will be found in files "Vehicle.cs" and "Assemble.cs".

The main method executes both questions at the same time, but it is easy to differentiate them thanks to the display.

Enjoy !
