Exercise 1:

1.
    Clean code is a code that is both easily understandable for a newcomer and easy to maintain.
    A clean code is the goal of every programmer, as it is the most professional and qualitative code possible for
    any project.

2.
    Yes, I think it is possible to "over-refactor" some code, because the programmer that coded first surely has not
    the same mindset as the one that refactors it. It becomes easy to create new problems that were not existing
    in the first solution if we want to refactor in a different way than what was used at first.

3.
    Code smells are indicators that the code is not clean and has problems. We have to bother about them because they
    can mean sometimes that there are more deep problems than what was seen at first glance.

4.
    In the former GuildedRose, there were a few problems regarding both the readability of the code (mostly because
    there were no comments and there were too much "if"s, therefore the code was difficult to understand) and its 
    execution, because the layout showed us that it was not very clean to read and understand.
    
5.
    We could have used the "Moving Features between Objects" technique, as there was a problem regarding the "Item.cs"
    file. In fact, it was terribly designed, as there was only one class for an item. With an implementation of 
    subclasses, you can simplify much more all the process of the quality/sellin update by stating special conditions
    for special objects.
